		<h2><em>Preparing to Become a Junior</em></h2>
        <p>This year I'm begining the preperation to become a junior in highschool at Gow. I stated this transtitoin by creating my schedules and deciding which classes I would want to take. Currently, I'm realizing how close I truely am to graduating and moving onto college. I can't lie that I'm a little frightened of this thought but everyone around me assures me I'll do fine. At the moment I have no idea what I'm going to study in school, but I'm trying not to focus on that, but rather what classes I'll take junior and senior year of highschool.
