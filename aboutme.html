        <h2><em>Sports</em></h2>
        <p>At school I love participating in many spoorts which include: Soccer, Basketball, and Lacrosse. Many of my friends play these sports with me and we have lots of laughs and many memories. This year I moved up from all the previous modified teams I played on and transitioned to the Varistity sports. All though we never won a champoinship this year, I have high hopes for the seasons to come. I also would like to add that <strong>basketball</strong> is by far my favorite sport I play. It is enjoyable with friends on and off the court.</p>
