        <h2><em>Mr. Bray</em></h2>
        
        <p>I have had <strong>Mr. Bray</strong> for two of my classes for almost a whole school year now. He has never failed to crack funny math jokes in both computer science and geometry class. Throughout the year he has taught me not only math lessons, but life lessons. I have leanered so much from Mr. Bray and I will never forget the lame math jokes that we made for a whole school year straight.</p>
